- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @puertaVictor
- ðŸ‘€ I have studied a Superior Degree in Web Application Development.
- ðŸŒ± Here I have my personal projects, I hope to see a big difference in a few years, because I'm afraid of these first ones that I can prepare within the code, but all the tricks that I use will surely help in the future :)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me... Mail => vIctOrpUEgAr@gmail.com
